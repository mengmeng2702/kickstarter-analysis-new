Based on the above analysis and graphs, we take out the outliers in the Box Plot top dots for both Goal and Pledged, then compare the blue and orange bar and come to a conclusion: Louise should try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
